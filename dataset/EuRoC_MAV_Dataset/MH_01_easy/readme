1. Imu timestamp is more longer than groudtruth.Imu data comes earlier and lasts for a little more time.
    imu_start--------------------------imu_end
            |                       |
         groud_start---------------groud_end
    So,a groud_aligned_imu dataset is create.
2. interval of groundtruth timesatamp is nearly 5ms.
    it has a format of:
#timestamp, p_RS_R_x [m], p_RS_R_y [m], p_RS_R_z [m], q_RS_w [], q_RS_x [], q_RS_y [], q_RS_z [], v_RS_R_x [m s^-1], v_RS_R_y [m s^-1], v_RS_R_z [m s^-1], 
            b_w_RS_S_x [rad s^-1], b_w_RS_S_y [rad s^-1], b_w_RS_S_z [rad s^-1], b_a_RS_S_x [m s^-2], b_a_RS_S_y [m s^-2], b_a_RS_S_z [m s^-2]
3. Interval of imu timestamp is  nearly 5ms.
   it has a format of:
#timestamp [ns],w_RS_S_x [rad s^-1],w_RS_S_y [rad s^-1],w_RS_S_z [rad s^-1],a_RS_S_x [m s^-2],a_RS_S_y [m s^-2],a_RS_S_z [m s^-2]

4. Images come at 20Hz. IMU data comes at 200Hz.
